Flash Card GUI to help you learn French.
## How does it work?
You are shown a word in French. You then have 5 seconds to think of its English translation. The card will automatically flip after 5 seconds.
<br /><br />Press the checkmark icon if you got it correct. Press the x icon if you got it wrong.
<br /><br />The next time you load the app, you will be shown all the words you got incorrect in your last session.
<br /><br />
To add more words, edit the french_words.csv in the data folder. Follow the format shown there
